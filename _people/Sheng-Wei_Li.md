Hello, my name is Sheng-Wei Li (李勝維) but you can call me Oscar. I recently graduated from NCTU with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I like playing darts and recently ranked up to (DARTSLIVE) RATING 9. Along with this, I also like to read novels. My all-time favorite novel is <a href="https://book.qidian.com/info/1003242530/">孺子帝</a>.

Additionally, my research interests lie in the field of Deep Learning, specifically in the areas of Multi-Modal Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Parameter-Efficient Tuning (Delta Tuning). I am passionate about exploring the potential of these technologies and finding ways to apply them in innovative and impactful ways.
