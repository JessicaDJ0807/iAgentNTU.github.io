Hi! My name is Sheng-Wei Li, also known as Oscar. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the National Chiao Tung University (NCTU).

While I enjoy recreational activities like playing darts (currently ranked (DARTSLIVE) RATING 9!), my true passion lies in the realm of artificial intelligence.  My research focuses on Deep Learning, particularly in Multi-Modal Deep Learning, Generative AI, and Efficient Tuning.  I am driven by the potential of these technologies to solve real-world problems and create impactful solutions.
