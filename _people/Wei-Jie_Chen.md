<br />
Hello there!  
I'm Wei-Jie Chen or Jack Chen, currently pursing master's degree in the department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University (NTU CSIE).  

I received my bachelor's degree in the department of Information Management, National Taiwan University (NTU IM), with Business Analytics (BA) Program.  

My research interests include but not limit to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science.  

And I've been to UK for six months as an exchange student, love exploring new things and traveling around the world.
